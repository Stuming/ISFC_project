# NSNT  
Natural Stimulus Neuroimaging Toolbox(NSNT) is aimed to provide toolbox 
to analysis fMRI data which was induced by natural stimulus.


# TODO List
### algorithms  
Undertake major calculation.  
Main function:
1. Cal ISFC, ISC, FC and others.
2. Cal info of data and result, like global waveform.

### io  
Load data from file, save data into file.<br>
Main function:
1. Read brain data and data info(like golbal_waveform.dat file). (Note: should specify the input arg.)
2. Save result as brain map.
3. Read result.
4. Save image into file.
5. Save movie into file.

### plot  
Plot image based on defferent input arg.  
Main function:
1. plot brain map.
2. plot global waveform and meanval.
3. plot head motion parameters.

### utils  
Provide small but necessary function.  
Main function:
* Should be specified.
