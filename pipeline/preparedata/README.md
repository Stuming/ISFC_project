Here is some scripts that I used to prepare studyforrest data, yet some maybe aborted.

Order of use:
    reconbash.sh: recon-all structure data, yet preprocessed structure data has been released by studyforrest. See: [psydata.ovgu.de/studyforrest/freesurfer]

    preproc-sess-bash: doing preproc-sess to functional MRI data.
    fcseed.sh: extract res data from preproced functional data.

    make_average_gumpsubject.sh: try to make average subject, may not useful.
